This is a hack on the osm-gps-map example viewer.

At the moment, all it does is read some pre-captured APRS packets, parse them for lat/long, and
plop a star on the map at the appropriate place.

It requires osm-gps-map libraries, and libfap libraries.  If you're using Arch Linux, you can install
both of these from AUR.

aprsmap uses waf for building.  To build:

./waf configure
./waf

To run:
./build/default/aprsmap
